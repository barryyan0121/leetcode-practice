# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

## Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place sorting).
- **Stability**: Yes, it maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Adaptability**: It can be optimized to stop early if no swaps are made in a pass, indicating that the list is sorted.

## Usage

Bubble Sort is not suitable for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity, but it is easy to understand and implement. It is often used for educational purposes to introduce sorting algorithms.
